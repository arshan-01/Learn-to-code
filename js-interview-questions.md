## Note on Using with GitHub

While GitHub markdown doesn't support colored highlighting in the same way as Google Docs, you can:

1. View this on GitHub where the backtick formatting (`Junior`, `Mid`, `Senior`) provides visual distinction
2. Import this into a tool like HackMD or similar which offers more formatting options
3. For a colored version, you could use this with GitHub Pages and add custom CSS
